#Problem Statement:
'''Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
'''

#My Solution:
'''Solution 1: Traversing on the array given and finding out the complement.
This solution has high time complexity and it is not much scalable. 
We only check the complement on the indexes greater than the current index. 
'''
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            new_target = target - nums[i]
            if new_target in nums[i+1:]:
                new_index = (nums[i+1:]).index(new_target)
                return [i, new_index+i+1]

'''Solution 2: We could use a hash to store the index and the element and reduce the time complexity
as finding something in a hash has near to constant time complexity.
'''
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        list_dict = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            #new_target = target - nums[i]
            if (target - nums[i]) in list_dict:
                return [list_dict[(target - nums[i])], i]
            list_dict[nums[i]] = i
